There once was a man who was living his normal life, until the ultimate test came upon him. One day, while walking down the street, his ears were serenaded with a music unlike any he had ever heard before. He wandered in the direction of the song and came upon the source of the sound: a boombox lying on the road. Coming from it was a song that changed his life forever - 1 2 Oatmeal.

Sam came by and heard the same song. He had never heard the song before. 
Sam decided that he did not like the song.
He's friend told him it was a meme.
Sam hoped that he never saw the mem.e
