There once was a man who was living his normal life, until the ultimate test came upon him. One day, while walking down the street, his ears were serenaded with a music unlike any he had ever heard before. He wandered in the direction of the song and came upon the source of the sound: a boombox lying on the road. Coming from it was a song that changed his life forever - 1 2 Oatmeal.

Sam came by and heard the same song. He had never heard the song before. 
Sam decided that he did not like the song.
He's friend told him it was a meme.
Sam hoped that he never saw the mem.e 

Sam's friend said "Sam, why don't you want to listen to the meme?"
Sam said, "Your meme is trash, I saw it on reddit already last week"
Sam's friend said "you reddit noob"

Sam's friend, trying to hold face while inside he felt the weight of the
world on top of him. Someone had already seen a meme. This sent Jax
(Sam's friend) into an existential crisis. What is reddit, what is life? What
even is a meme?
